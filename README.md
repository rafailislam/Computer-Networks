# Computer-Networks
I am taking this course as I was always curious about 'Behind the Scene' of todays computer networks. I am learning very basic yet interesting topic in computer networks including OSI layer model, TCP/IP protocol, Digital and analog signal encoding, Client-server concepts,Network topologies, Peer-to-peer architecture etc. Along with the theoretical study we did some coding assigment. I am here sharing those coding assignemts.
This repo provides only coding assignments. If you find any bugs (of course there are some bugs), please help to find bugs.
